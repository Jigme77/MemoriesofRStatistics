So hello- I'm so happy to meet you guys and give this talk on how to learn. Learning is prerequisite for a school. However, as a students, one is rarely taught how to learn effectively.

# .shadow-text[I love learning.]

???
I feel it is prerequisite for everyone to love learning. In the 21st century, information is available everywhere.But as a student, it has been hard climb. We are bombarded with constant distraction. 
I try learning new things. I can programme a bit in R and beginner in python programming. I I try to read a lot now.

Here's who I know you are...

You're an student. You want to learn. You want to do good in life. Probably, learning has been not easy for you.

You have many materials or subjects or modules to read ...

# How do you learn to ride a bicycle

> # Learning should be like learning to ride a bicycle. You don't give up until you ride them.

???
Learning should be like riding a bicycle and treated like it. If you think carefully, the analogy is same. You will not leave learning the bike half-baked because it is life and death situation. However, in learning - we tend not to understand the concepts really well.

# So how do we really learn

## Fixed Mindset
]
--
.pull-right[

- ### I can work hard
-------------------
--
## Growth Mindset
]


???
before really going into it lets talk about our mindsets. Sometimes we feel that we are not cut out for something. I am not at this, I am not good at this. What you need to do is cultivate a growth mindset. Shift your perspective from fixed mindset to growth mindset. Say I can grow.

# How to Learn

--
## 1. UNDERSTANDING 

--
## 2. REMEMBERING

--
## 3. FOCUSING


---
class: middle, center

# UNDERSTANDING

???

Understanding a concept is the first prerequisite to learning. If you do not understand, there is no point in remembering.

# Feynman technique

--
### Teaching it to someone

--
> #### If you cannot explain it simply, you haven't understood


--
## How to go about it?

--
- ### Keep the language as simple as possible. Try translating it to your native tongue.

- ### Drill down to the essence

???
In general, keep the language simple. Try explaining it in own language.

Drill down to the essence. How can I explain it in simple words, as simple as possible. For example, what is a research hypothesis? It is a claim that you are making.

---

# Question to ask as you learn some new concepts? 

## - Does this make sense? Could I explain this to a 5 year old?

## - Explain it to your friends. Ask why? Try explaining, if you cannot explain, then go back and study the concept, fill the gap.

# The Science of Active Recall

> ### Retrieving information memory through, essentially, testing yourself at every stage of the revision process.

## Evidence

--
- The first group would read the material only once.

--
- The second group would read the material four times.

--
- The third group would read the material then were told to make a mind map.

--
- The fourth group would red the material once, then recall as much as possible.

--
> Karpicke, J. D., & Blunt, J. R. (2011). Retrieval practice produces more learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. Science, 331(6018), 772-775.

# Strategy

--
### - Think about what you have learned

--
### - Test on the concept

--
### - Practice Retrieval

--
### - Trust the process

> #### “Test ourselves as a way to learn new concepts.”


> #### Improving students’ learning with effective learning techniques: promising direction from cognitive and educational psychology. ~ Dunlosky et al. (2013)

# Taking notes during class
----

## - Handwritten notes are better (University of Washington Research)

## - Harder you have to work for something, better the results

## - Use mindmap to write notes

> ### "Notetaking during class also drives away sleep."

---

# Taking notes after class

## - Build active recall questions

> ### "Consolidate understanding with active recall."

---
# Scoping the subject?

> ### "Where does the subject fits in whole?"

## - Don't lose the forest for the trees.

## - Look at the syllabus or the module descriptor. 

## - Get the gist of the subject as a whole.

---
# Why do you need to understand?

- **First step towards real learning**

- **If you understand, it is easier to retain**

- **How do you know that you have understood?**
    - Internal coherence
    - Gold standard is to explain it to 5 year olds 
- **Have a mental model of the subject or concepts**
- **Create your own syllabus if you are stuck (find your own resouces)**

> ### You can't know everything, but you have to know some things really well.
